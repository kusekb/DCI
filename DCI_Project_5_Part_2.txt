# Project 3, Task 1:

cd ~/bin
nano hungry.sh

# inside the bash file, we will type these commands:

#	#!/bin/bash
#	echo "I am hungry. Feed me data." >> ~/demands.txt
#	date >> ~/demands.log

ls

# the bash file won't be green (an executable)

chmod +x hungry.sh

ls

# now it should be green. let's test it!

hungry.sh
cd ~
ls
cat demands.txt demands.log

# Project 3, Task 2:

crontab -e

# Since we're using nano, press 1 if you haven't done so before
# inside of crontab, we will type this row into the table:

#	* * * * * bash ~/bin/hungry.sh

# Now all we have to do is wait a few minutes and check the results!

cd ~
ls
cat demands.txt demands.log
