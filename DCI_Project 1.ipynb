    "We've successfuly created 3 frequency tables that all relate to the genres of apps on the Apple and Google market. Let's analyze them one by one, starting from the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. The App Store Market\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apple market is dominated by *Games* apps with over half of the marketshare at ~60%. *Entertainment* is at a far-away second place percentage of ~8%. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you add in the percentage of *Entertainment*, *Photo & Video*, *Social Networking*, *Sports*, and *Music* apps to the ~60% marketshare that *Games* have, the number jumps up to ~80%. So basically, 4 out of every 5 apps on the Apple Store are entertainment based. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. The Google Play Market\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the Apple dataset, this dataset has much more variety of genres. The most common category is *Family* and *Game* apps, but there is a sizable chunk of non-entertainment apps in the marketshare. \n",
    "\n",
    "More surprisingly, the most common genre of app is *Tools* at ~8% of the marketshare. Second place is *Entertainment* at ~6%. There are a lot of mixed genres that games have, but it is important to note that if our company decided to make a *Business* or *Productivity* app in the Google market, we would still have a chance to reach people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Making a Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "For our company to succeed in the Apple market, we'll need to produce entertainment apps, preferably games, in order to reach the largest number of people for ad revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the choice to make games and family apps isn't as dire in the Google market, it's still the best choice for our company to reach the most people in the Google market as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our company's strategy is to **start** in the Google market and then proceed to the Apple market if and only if the app is profitable after 6 months, this gives our company the chance to see if our app can profit in the smaller percentage of market that games have in the Google Play market first before we move to the giant gaming marketshare of the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our entertainment apps will have to succeed in the widely varied Google Play market. It's not easy for us to assume that if they succeed there, they will succeed in the saturated Apple Store market as well, but in order to reach the large market of the App Store, we will have to take risks as a company and produce games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, these frequency tables only show how **many** apps of each genre are on the market and don't show us how many users **actually downloaded** these apps. So, we'll need to do some further research to narrow our decision to more specific types of apps in the game area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Building Frequency Tables by Most Popular Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the Google dataset documentation, we know that the column at index *5* is for *Installs*, or the number of downloads. But we don't have this information for the Apple dataset. So we'll get around that by using the *rating_count_tot* column at index *5* as a substitute.\n",

    "First, we'll loop through the genres frequency table that we just created. Each time we do this, we'll set two variables to zero: the total number of user ratings, and the number of apps per genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll loop through every entry in the cleaned Apple dataset and see if we find a match. We will be on a certain genre, so if an app matches it, we'll store it into a variable and then iterate a variable by one to count that app. We'll also add the number of ratings that app has to the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the total user ratings and number of apps, we can divide them respectively to get the average number of user ratings per genre. This will give us an idea of which genres are the most popular with users."

    "## 9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear from the Google Play store that utility based apps do have a large amount of downloads, but our original hypothesis of focusing on game and entertainment apps has some basis too despite the saturated market. Clearly the markets for both types of apps are profitable on Google Play, but our company wants to focus on a certain type of app. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what to do? If games and entertainment are based on the rare ability to successfuly make viral content, and utility apps don't always work cross-platform, what do we choose to recommend to our company? *Medical*, *Parenting*, *Weather*, *Sports*, *Lifestyle*, *Health & Fitness*, and *Dating* are all situationally useful. *Most people aren't guaranteed to keep using these apps once downloaded*. We need to recommend something to our company that people will constantly use on the Google Play store that will translate to a large userbase in the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since *Navigation* and *Education* apps require a large degree of knowledge to produce, let's narrow it down to the next best option, and it's a lucrative one. If our company chooses to focus in the *Books & Reference* genre, we would reach a large userbase in both markets and succeed in accruing ad revenue on a constant basis. However, the are already industry giants that are inflating the statistics of this genre, so it's best to stay away, despite how good it seems on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our final decision is to recommend making gaming apps to our company, but we need a little more feedback before we can determine what types of games to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Narrowing Down the Final Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "After pitching the idea of making free games, the company changed it's position. They feel that typical free games don't last as long on the market as they would want them to, so they are open to paid content to keep users coming back. However, they only want to do so if there is enough positive feedback. Therefore, we need to find apps that have high user ratings and high download quantities so that we can narrow down what type of game to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't generated a frequency table of the *Genres* column of the Google dataset yet, so we can use this to help us find out. Once we create this frequency table, we'll use the *Ratings* column to determine which genres of games are the most well rated overall in the Google market and recommend some to the company."

    "By observing the ratings, we can see that *Puzzle*, *Strategy*, *Brain*, *etc.* games seem to get the most positive reviews. This narrows are focus and allows us to recommend these types of apps to the company, and with large user bases and highly positive feedback, it would be in our best interest to offer paid content in the form of extra puzzles or challenges to increase revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our final recommendation to the company is to produce free *Puzzle*, *Strategy*, *Brain*, *etc.* based games that require watching ads to continue, and/or purchasing extra content in order to remove ads or play exclusive content. If our game becomes profitable after a 6 month period on the Google Play store, it will be able to enjoy a large userbase in the App Store as well. Because these types of games are so well reviewed, we can be confident that users will not complain or lose interest in our apps because of ads or paid content."
