Part 1:

ls /etc				# show all files in /etc
ls /run				# show all files in /run

ls /etc 1> file1.txt		# redirect output stream to file1.txt
ls /run > file2.txt 		# redirect output stream to file2.txt

head file1.txt			# shows the first few lines of file1.txt to see if it worked
head file2.txt			# does the same for file2.txt

Part 2:

man cat				# you can concatenate more than one file together
man sort			# you can sort by reversed alphabetical order with -r

cat file1.txt file2.txt | tee unsorted.txt | sort -r > reversed.txt		
				
				# the first part combines both files together
				# tee takes a “snapshot” of what we have in stdin
				# since sort takes stdin, we can stdout to a new file

head unsorted.txt		# we can see this is just both files mashed together
head reversed.txt		# the contents have been sorted reverse alphabetically
